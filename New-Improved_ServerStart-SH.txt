Servers should be listed 1 through X (where x is the number of
servers) user selections should be made by inputting one by one
the number of the server(s) they would like to start. Once the
user has finished selecting all the servers they would like to
start, pass the array containing all the user selections to the
StartServers function where it will run a for loop for however
many selections the user has made. The for loop will itterate
through all the selections, starting each server, until none
are left.
